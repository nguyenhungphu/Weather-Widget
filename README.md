This Project purpose is to Build n deploy weather widget that use navigator geolocation API 
to get user location and uses that location to obtain current weather
and 5 day forecast for their region

Notes:
utilize at least 2 different endpoints of Open Weather Map API:
Current Weather Data & 5 Days 3 Hr forecast
forecast is 3hr blocks means recieve 8 different temp forcasts per day. 
choose a single time everday that will be used as condition for the day
Output should indicate 'Current Conditions' as today and 5days forecast
Need to use weather icons provieded by API
*Temp are defaulted Kelvin so it need to be pass a extra parameter to endpoint to request different unit
